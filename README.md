vacuumCleanerAgent
==================

A simple vacuumCleaner agent implementation based on the first two chapters of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" book by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig.

The Maze is not implemented yet but you can still try the random option!

Look for the 4 samples of agents in the main.js!
